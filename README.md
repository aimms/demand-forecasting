## Story

Imagine you have a small cookie factory. And for a few months, you stored the demand data you had each day and now, you want to use this data in a way to forecast your possible future demand. This analysis will create understanding in how your demand will behaviour and decrease waste.

However, since you are not really sure which algorithm to use, your goal is to create a dashboard with all algorithm available to choose the best fit for your factory.
